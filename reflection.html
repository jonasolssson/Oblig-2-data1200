        During our planning and sketching, we came up with several layouts and ideas for the wireframes. 
        Initially, we decided to use a slideshow or «carousel» as our layout. We thought that it was easily 
        accessible for the phone and laptop screen. However, we were unsure of what coding to use, and knowing 
        it would involve some javascript we discarded the idea. We also realized that carousels might not be the most pleasing 
        solution for a phone screen. Therefore, we chose a more structured layout that would create 
        a clean website.

        One of the difficult aspects of translating from a wireframe to an actual page was the sizing and 
        framing of the pictures and layout. A challenge occurred while we were reducing the width of the screen. 
        The text did not follow along with the text-box as we reduced the screen size. Additionally, the pictures 
        did not cover the length of the container; the proportions were off. We used the media queries to change 
        the layout of the grid and correct it.

        When deciding on the structure and tags used in the html we chose not to use the picture-tag. And rather 
        went with using the srcset-attribute for our images. We went with using the same images for both layots, 
        and utilized the srcset attribute to apply different css rules for the image when a screen is narrower than 650px.
        We found that this kept our html less complex, and therefore faster loading. We also thought styling the picture 
        differently with css made more sense than making the browser load two different images.
