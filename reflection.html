    <p>her skriver vi refleksjonen vår

        During our planning and sketching, we came up with several layouts and ideas for the wireframes. 
        Initially, we decided to use a slideshow or «carousel» as our layout. We thought that it was 
        easily accessible for the phone and laptop screen.  However, we were unsure of what coding to use 
        and how it would be presented on a phone screen. Therefore, we chose a more structured layout that 
        would create a clean website.

        One of the difficult aspects of translating from a wireframe to an actual page was the sizing and 
        framing of the pictures and layout.
