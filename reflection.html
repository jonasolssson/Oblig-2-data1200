    <p>her skriver vi refleksjonen vår

        During our planning and sketching, we came up with several layouts and ideas for the wireframes. 
        Initially, we decided to use a slideshow or «carousel» as our layout. We thought that it was 
        easily accessible for the phone and laptop screen.
