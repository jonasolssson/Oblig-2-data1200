        During our planning and sketching, we came up with several layouts and ideas for the wireframes. 
        Initially, we decided to use a slideshow or «carousel» as our layout. We thought that it was easily 
        accessible for the phone and laptop screen. However, we were unsure of what coding to use and how it 
        would be presented on a phone screen. Therefore, we chose a more structured layout that would create 
        a clean website.

        One of the difficult aspects of translating from a wireframe to an actual page was the sizing and 
        framing of the pictures and layout. A challenge occurred while we were reducing the width of the screen. 
        The text did not follow along with the text-box as we reduced the screen size. Additionally, the pictures 
        did not cover the length of the container; the proportions were off. We used the media queries to change 
        the layout of the grid and make the layout correct again.
